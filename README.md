## 📘 Project Overview
The **AgriData Explorer** project focuses on analyzing India's agricultural data to understand crop production trends, yield patterns, and cultivated area insights using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques.

This project aims to support data-driven decisions for improving productivity and understanding historical trends in Indian agriculture.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about:
- Crop names and production quantity  
- Area of cultivation (in hectares)  
- Yield (tonnes/hectare)  
- State and district-wise data  
- Year-wise agricultural statistics (1970–2024)  

---

## 🧮 Python EDA Highlights
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Visualization of top 10 crops by production  
- State-wise production comparison  
- Yearly trends of key crops (Rice, Wheat, Sugarcane)  
- Correlation between area and production  

---

## 🗄️ SQL Queries Performed
Sample queries included:
1. Top 5 crops by total production  
2. State with maximum yield in the latest year  
3. Average yield by crop type  
4. Total area cultivated per state  
5. Yearly growth trend of rice production  

(SQL results included in the final PDF.)

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
Dashboard visuals created:
- **KPI Cards:** Total production, yield, and cultivated area  
- **Bar Chart:** Crop-wise production  
- **Line Chart:** Yearly yield trend  
- **Pie Chart:** Crop distribution by area  
- **Heatmap:** State vs Crop yield comparison  

---

## 🏁 Insights & Recommendations
- Rice, Wheat, and Sugarcane dominate India’s production landscape.  
- States like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra have consistent yield efficiency.  
- Need for yield improvement programs in drought-prone regions.  
- Technology adoption (IoT & precision farming) can further optimize productivity.
